# tEnvoy

# WARNING:
The following code is NOT AUDITED and NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION. The Cryptico library serving as the base for the tEnvoy wrapper is not audited and has questionable origins. Alternatives such as CryptoJS have similar drawbacks.

We are creating a new version of tEnvoy at https://github.com/TogaTech/tEnvoy which will use the Web Cryptography API, with the same method headers and return behaviors.
